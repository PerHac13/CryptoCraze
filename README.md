# CryptoCraze

CryptoCraze is a web-based project aimed at increasing awareness about blockchain technology in India through a user-friendly frontend interface. Our goal is to provide comprehensive and easy-to-understand information about blockchain technology, its potential applications, and how it can benefit individuals and businesses.

## Background

Blockchain technology is a decentralized and secure way to store and transfer digital assets without the need for intermediaries like banks or financial institutions. It has the potential to disrupt many industries, including finance, healthcare, and supply chain management.
